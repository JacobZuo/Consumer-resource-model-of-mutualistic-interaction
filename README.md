# Consumer-resource-model-of-mutualistic-interaction

This is the repo of consumer resource model simulation of the Paper: Help must be compensated- synergistic pectin deconstruction premises mutualistic interactions between honeybee gut bacteria

### Info

The ODE model is set as the funtion `C_R_Model.m`.

The Interaction of G to B can be plotted with the scripts `Pariwise_Interactions.m`.

The Phase diagrams can be plotted with `Phase_Diagram.m`
